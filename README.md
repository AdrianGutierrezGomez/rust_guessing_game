# Rust Guessing Game
This is chapter 2 of "The Rust Programming Language"

## Things I learned
- Using cargo init inside this dir. (Something simple as that to initialize cargo in this directory)
- How to write a comment! // This would be a comment in Rust.
- How to use crates!
- Variables are defined with let and can be mutable with mut.
- How to use methods.
- String::new() would be similar to a constructor? Need to review this on next chapter.
- A teaser into what a reference in Rust is like. & <- reference
- A teaser into error handling. 
- Print values with placerholders
