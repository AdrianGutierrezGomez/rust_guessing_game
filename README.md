# Rust Guessing Game
This is chapter 2 of "The Rust Programming Language"

## Things I learned

- Using cargo init inside this dir. Something simple as that to initialize cargo in this directory 

    `cargo init`
- How to write a comment! // This would be a comment in Rust.
- How to use crates!
- Variables are defined with let and can be mutable with mut.
- How to use methods.
- String::new() would be similar to a constructor? Need to review this on next chapter.
- A teaser into what a reference in Rust is like. & <- reference
- A teaser into error handling. 
- Print values with placerholders
- Hot to read docs from crates. 

    `cargo doc --open`
- How to use the match expression.
- How to use Shadowing feature. (Reusing a variable without creating a new one)
- How to use loops 
- Handling errors with a catch all (_)
- Using:
    - `cargo run`
    - `cargo build`
    - `cargo build --relase`

## How to execute the program 
There is an optimized executable in 
`target/release/rust_guessing_game`
